Exceptions in Java are events that disrupt normal program flow.
Checked exceptions must be handled or declared in the method signature.
Unchecked exceptions (RuntimeExceptions) do not require explicit handling.
Try-catch blocks are used to handle exceptions.
Finally block executes regardless of exception occurrence.
